### HEYYYY 👋

Hey folks! I'm hanging out in the digital playground of Dreamfarm Studios, coding up a storm as a Software Developer.
My buddies here are 3D design gurus - they're teaching me the secret handshake of Adobe wizardry and the cool spells of WebGL and OpenGL.
It's like learning to surf in a sea of polygons and textures. We're meshing code and design, one epic pixel party at a time!

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on .Net, Flutter, C++ and JS (Vue) projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **3D STUFF** and with a hint of **Complex Algorithms**.
- ⚡ Fun fact:
> Did you know? The term 'debugging' was popularized by Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s when she literally removed a moth from her computer - now that's what I call hands-on problem solving! As a multilingual programmer dabbling in AI, Computer Architecture, and Robotics, I like to think I'm continuing the tradition - minus the actual bugs!
