### HEYYYY ðŸ‘‹

Hey folks! I'm hanging out in the digital playground of Dreamfarm Studios, coding up a storm as a Software Developer.
My buddies here are 3D design gurus - they're teaching me the secret handshake of Adobe wizardry and the cool spells of WebGL and OpenGL.
It's like learning to surf in a sea of polygons and textures. We're meshing code and design, one epic pixel party at a time!

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on .Net, Flutter, C++ and JS (Vue) projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **3D STUFF** and with a hint of **Complex Algorithms**.
